## üöö **Shipping Cost Consistency**

### **Shipping Flow**:
1. **Cart Page**: Customer selects country and sees shipping cost
2. **Checkout Page**: Same shipping cost is used (no recalculation)
3. **Order Creation**: Same shipping cost is stored in order
4. **Invoice**: Same shipping cost appears in invoice
5. **Shipment**: Same shipping cost is used for shipment record

### **Technical Implementation**:

#### **Cart Page**:
```javascript
// Shipping cost calculated and passed to checkout
onClick={() => onNavigate('checkout', { 
  shippingCountry: selectedCountry, 
  shippingCost: shippingCost 
})}
```

#### **Checkout Page**:
```javascript
// Uses shipping cost from cart (no recalculation)
const [shippingCost, setShippingCost] = useState(shippingData?.shippingCost || 0);

// Prevents recalculation if shipping cost already set
const calculateShippingForAddress = async () => {
  // If shipping cost is already set from cart, don't recalculate
  if (shippingData?.shippingCost !== undefined) {
    console.log('üöö Using shipping cost from cart:', shippingData.shippingCost);
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of calculation only if needed
};
```

#### **Order Creation**:
```javascript
// Shipping cost passed to order creation
const customerInfo = {
  fullName: `${shippingInfo.firstName} ${shippingInfo.lastName}`,
  email: shippingInfo.email,
  contact: shippingInfo.phone,
  address: `${shippingInfo.address}, ${shippingInfo.city}, ${shippingInfo.state} ${shippingInfo.zipCode}, ${shippingInfo.country}`,
  shippingCost: shippingCost, // Same cost from cart
  note: `Payment method: ${paymentMethod}. Shipping: ${selectedShipping}`
};
```

### **Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **No Surprises**: Shipping cost never changes unexpectedly
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Billing**: Customer pays exactly what they see
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Experience**: Same cost from cart to invoice
- ‚úÖ **Reliable System**: No calculation errors or discrepancies
